# Word(s) Search [contributed by F.R. Salvador]
## This program is the solution to the Word-Search problem tasks.

+ Write 6 seperate functions that return values as respective answers to the following questions:
  + Q1: Is the word ```program``` in the list? (Note: this is a searching problem. Functions should return 1, if yes, otherwise 0)
  + Q2: How many ```10```-letter words that start with the letter g are there in the list? (for example: _gatekeeper_)
  + Q3: How many words begin with the letter ```q``` and ends with the letter ```t```?
  + Q4: How many words are there that do not contain any vowel? (for example: _fry_)
  + Q5: How many words are there that start with the string ```unli```? (for example: _unlimited_)  
  + Q6: (Bonus Question): What is the longest word? (note: your function must search for this word)
